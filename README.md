# 4-1-MUX
A 4:1 Mux has 4 input lines which are selected depending upon the 2 select line input values. This particular design is modeled structurally using fundamental logic gates and is written in Verilog. The simulation is observed for the input values '0101' and the multiplexer behavior is verified.
